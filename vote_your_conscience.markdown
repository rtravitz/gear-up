# Vote Your Conscience

## Introduction (5 min)
To advance our mission of "unlocking human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers," Turing has a responsibility to actively support students' development of civic and community-oriented skills. In order to be a responsible citizen and advance diversity and inclusion in the tech field, students will need to think critically about systems and structures. They will need to have developed a clear understanding of how to align their actions and values in these systems and have skills for constructively challenging those systems when they are unjust and promote inequity.

A successful Turing graduate is engaged, intentional, and well-informed when evaluating how to participate meaningfully in their communit(y/ies). Today, we will use the upcoming election as a opportunity to develop the awareness and skills we need to meet this aspiration.

Sit with your groups in your assigned locations. Make sure to assign someone in your group the role of timekeeper, facilitator, and listening monitor to remind everyone to practice active listening. Take collective responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

## What is a Citizen?
### Read (5 min)
Read [this summary](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/citizenship-rights-and-responsibilities) by US Citizenship and Immigration Services and scan the article by Brett and Kate McKay, [A Citizen's Bill of Responsibilities](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/09/26/citizens-bill-responsibilities/) (September 26, 2016; note: in spite of its unconventional source, this article is one of the more entertaining, clear, and constructive treatments of the topic available online. Focus on the spirit of the article). You may also enjoy this _Washington Post_ article by Eugene Volokh, ["Is the United States of America a Republic or a Democracy?"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/13/is-the-united-states-of-america-a-republic-or-a-democracy/?utm_term=.3df98233fecf) for a bit more background on what republic and democracy mean for the United States. 

### Write (5 min)

## Choose Your Own Adventure
Pick one of the following three topics to explore in more depth.

### Reading & Writing (20 min)
Read the articles and reflect on the questions within your topic.

### TOPIC 1: To Vote or Not to Vote
Democracy makes sense in theory, but by some accounts its integrity in the US has disintegrated over the last 50 years.
* ["US Voter Turnout Trails Most Developed Countries"](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/), _Pew Research Center_ (August 2, 2016)
* ["Is America an Oligarchy?"](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/is-america-an-oligarchy), _The New Yorker_ (April 18, 2014)

#### Reflection Questions
* Describe your attitude toward voting and participating in the US electoral system.
* How is the idea of citizenship important to the sustainability of democracy? In your own experience, how might individuals' current attitudes toward voting threaten US democracy?
* Compare what a citizen needs to do to support democracy against your current attitudes towards civic responsibility and your perception of mainstream attitudes towards voting. How do you reconcile these? What level of involvement is most consist with the values you hold?

### TOPIC 2: Information Intermediaries: Who Can Help You Vote Smart
Few voters have the time to individually research the positions and backgrounds of all candidates on a ballot and thus defer to trusted authorities to help them decide who to support. 
  * Political Party Nominations
  * Celebrity Endorsements ([Save the Day (pro-Hillary)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRp1CK_X_Yw ), [Celebrities Who Support Trump](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/celebrities-who-support-donald-trump/))
  * Elected Official Endorsements: elected officials officially cannot endorse in their capacity as elected official, but can do so as private citizens ([The Endorsement Primary (Presidential Candidate Endorsements)](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/))
  * Voter-Guides: Non-profits provide constituents with information about candidates' positions and record, often with a bent toward their organizational priorities. These organizations cannot endorse.
  * Other organizations _can_ endorse ([Why Some Newspapers Are Abandoning Endorsements](http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/why_some_newspapers_are_abandoning_endorsements.php))

Here are details about a few voters' guides and other voter resources that serve as examples of how trusted, credible organizations can help you decide who to support by taking some of the legwork out of researching issues and candidates yourselves. 
  * [League of Women Voters: Voter Guide](http://lwv.org/blog/compare-presidential-candidates-our-voters%E2%80%99-guide)
  * [Oakland App Sheds Light on Campaign Finance](http://www.govtech.com/data/Oakland-App-Sheds-Light-on-Campaign-Finance.html)
  * [A Startup for Smarter (and More) Voters](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorikozlowski/2012/07/13/a-startup-for-smarter-and-more-voters/)

Review the three resources directly above and reflect on the questions below. 

#### Reflection Questions
* Are there organizations that you trust to gather information about candidates or whose endorsements you value? If you don't know, how could you find out?
* Step back and reflect on how your opinion of candidates are shaped. What are your primary sources for gathering an impression of candidates? Reflect on whether and how these sources help you pick candidates most aligned to your goals and values. 
* If you dedicate 10 hours before every election to make an informed decision, what would be the best way to use it? For example: Watching the news, reading a voter guide, consulting endorsements from trusted organizations, seeing a candidate speak, etc.

### TOPIC 3: Vetting Leaders
The most striking exposure most of us have with US democracy is through media attention given to US presidential elections. Although of major importance, the US presidential election is not the only election that matters. Other (smaller) statewide and local offices can have a significant, direct impact on our lives (safety, infrastructure, education) and can be powerful voices in a national conversation about how to support healthy, connected communities. 

Statewide and local races, due in part to less attention from the media, provide a less cluttered lens for us to tease apart what's important to you when vetting potential leaders. Browse through these few articles, then reflect on the questions below. 
* [America’s Mayors: Put Us in Charge—Now](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/cities-urban-policy-mayors-survey-revitalization-us-214151), _Politico_ (August 8, 2016)
* [Choosing a Leader: 3 Things to Look For](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2012/04/16/choosing-a-leader-3-things-to-look-for/#23f69567aec0), _Forbes_ (April 16, 2012)
* [Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?](https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men), _Harvard Business Review_ (August 22, 2013)

#### Reflection Questions
* Consider one of your favorite leaders? What qualities do they have? What makes them successful? What makes them appealing to you?
* When considering different candidates, what qualities do you look for? 
* Do you feel there is a shortage of candidates you are excited about or want to vote for? Why do you think that is?
* Would you ever consider running for office? Why or why not? Do you think some of your concerns (if any) also keep other promising candidates out of politics? How could you change your engagement with the electoral system to make it less hostile to otherwise quality leaders?
